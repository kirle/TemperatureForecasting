# TemperatureForecasting
The purpose of this project is to develop and test different temperature prediction models using a dataset that includes various variables such as pressure and humidity.

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data . 

The Historical Hourly Weather Data dataset is a collection of hourly weather data for different cities around the world. The dataset includes information on temperature, humidity, pressure, wind direction, and speed, among other variables. The data was collected over several years (2012-2017), providing a rich source of information for climate modeling. The dataset is distributed along different CSV files containing the different features.
